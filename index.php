With help of this site you can spoof a very default windows login screen. (Close enough for DAUs, i hope)</br>
The typed in password will be written in a file as of now. </br>
In the future i want to add a few small features like choosing different backgrounds, supporting more resolutions, </br>
different languages and simulating the few seconds of waiting after entering your password with a loading animation.</br></br>

<H2>How to use:</H2>
You have to open this page (index) and set your settings. Then you have to open the phishing page with the button.</br>
The newly opened page is a javascript-called window and can close itself after entering the "password" (Due to some javascript restrictions).</br>
Now close the first page and make the phishing page fullscreen. Have fun!

<H2>Antisleep</H2>
i have added a javascript from here https://github.com/ivanmaeder/computer-sleep </br>
It should play a soundfile without sound in the background.</br>
I have not tested it!! But i know that at least Firefox needs to whitelist the site to autoplay media. You can do that in the url bar on the very left. </br>
Again: untested!
